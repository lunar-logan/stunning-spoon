Blast :Pyricularia (Magnaporteh) grisea
Symptoms:
All aboveground parts of the rice plant (leaves, leaf collar, culm, culm nodes, neck, and panicle) are attacked by the fungus.
initial symptoms are white to gray-green lesions or spots with brown borders.
Small specks originate on leaves - subsequently enlarge into spindle shaped spots(0.5 to 1.5cm length, 0.3 to 0.5cm width) with ashy center.
older lesions elliptical or spindle-shaped and whitish to gray with necrotic borders Several spots coalesce to  form big irregular patches.
nodal infection causes the culm to break at the infected node.
Internodal infection also occurs at the base of the plant which causes white panicles similar to that induced by yellow stem borer or water deficit.
Lesions on the neck are grayish brown and causes the girdling of the neck and the panicle to fall over.
If infection of the neck occurs before milk stage, no grain is formed, but if infection occurs later, grains of poor quality are formed.
Lesions on the branches of the panicles and on the spikelet pedicels are brown to dark brown.
The size and shape of the spots vary on different rice varieties.
Identification of pathogen:
This disease is caused by a fungus named Pyricularia orizae, which overwinters in rice seeds and infected rice stubble.
The fungus reproductive structures, spores, can spread from these two sources to rice plants during the next growing season and initiate new infections.
Spores from these new infections can spread by wind to other rice plants over great distances.
The conidiophores of the pathogen are produced in clusters from each stoma. They are rarely solitary with 2-4 septa. The basal area of the conidiophores is swollen and tapers toward the lighter apex.
The conidia of the fungus measure 20-22 x 10-12 µm. The conidia are 2-septate, translucent, and slightly darkened. They are obclavate and tapering at the apex. They are truncate or extended into a short tooth at the base.
The perfect stage is rarely found in the field.
Management:

Cultural methods
Planting resistant varieties against the rice blast is the most practical and economical way of controlling rice blast.
Use of Tolerant varieties (CO 47, CO 50, ADT 36,ADT 37,ASD 16,ASD 20,ADT 39,ASD 19,TPS 3,White ponni,ADT 44,BPT 5204,CORH , Palghuna, Swarnamukhi, Swathi, Prabhat, IR - 64, , IR - 36, Jaya).
Avoid excess N - fertilizer application.
Apply nitrogen in three split doses.
Remove weed hosts from bunds.
Preventive methods
Avoid dry nurseries.
Avoid late planting.
Burning of straw and stubbles after harvest.
Avoid grasses and other weeds on bunds and inside.
Dry seed treatment with Pseudomonas fluorescens talc formulation @10g/kg of seed.
Stagnate water to a depth of 2.5cm over an area of 25m2 in the nursery. Sprinkle 2.5 kg of P. fluorescens (talc) and mix with stagnated water. Soak the root system of seedlings for 30 min and transplant.
Spray P. fluorescens talc formulation @ 0.5% from 45 days after transplanting at 10 day intervals, three times.
Chemical methods
Do not apply lower/higher doses of fungicides.
Spray before 11.00 AM/after 3.00 PM.
Avoid noon hours for spraying.
Seed treatment at 2.0 g/kg seed with Captan or Carbendazim or Thiram or Tricyclazole.
Systemic fungicides such as pyroquilon and tricyclazole are possible chemicals for controlling the disease.
Spraying of Tricyclazole at 1g/lit of water or Carbendazim at 1.0 gm/lit.
3 to 4 sprays each at nursery, tillering stage and panicle emergence stage may be required for complete control.
Nursery stage: Light infection - Spray Carbendazim @ 1.0 gm/lit.
Pre-Tillering to Mid-Tillering: Light at 2 to 5 % disease severities - Apply Carbendazim @ 1.0 gm/lit. Delay top dressing of N fertilizers when infection is seen.
Panicle initiation to booting: At 2 to 5% leaf area damage- spray Carbendazim or Tricyclazole @ 1.0 gm/lit.
Flowering and after: At 5 % leaf area damage or 1 to 2 % neck infection spray Carbendazim or Tricyclazole @ 1 g /lit of water.


Sheath Rot:Sarocladium oryzae
Symptoms:
Discoloration in the flag leaf sheath.
Rotting occurs on the leaf sheath that encloses the young panicles.
Irregular spots or lesions, with dark reddish brown margins and gray center.
Discoloration in the sheath.
lesions enlarge and often coalesce and may cover the entire leaf sheath.
Severe infection causes entire or parts of young panicles to remain within the sheath.
Unemerged panicles rot and florets turn red-brown to dark brown.
Whitish powdery growth inside the affected sheaths and young panicles.
Infected panicles and  grains are sterile, shriveled, partially or unfilled, and discolored.
The disease is important during the heading towards the maturity stages of the rice crop.
Lesions develop on the uppermost leaf sheaths that enclose the panicles.
Some panicles do not emerge or emerge partially.
Rotting of the sheath and the development of whitish powdery fungal growth is usually observed.
Favourable conditions: High amount of nitrogen, high relative humidity, and dense crop growth favors sheath rot development. The fungus grows best at 20 to 28°C.
Identification of pathogen:
The fungus produces white mycelium, sparsely branched, septate, and measures 1.5-2m in diameter.
Conidiophores arising from the mycelium are slightly thicker than the vegetative hyphae, branched once or twice, each time with 3-4 branches in a whorl.
The ultimate branches are phialides and produce conidia that are, cylindrical to slightly fusiform, often somewhat curved, hyaline, smooth, single-celled, 4-9 x 1-2.5 m.
In some cases, the fungus infects the sheath in combination with bacterial pathogens attacking the sheath and causing grain discoloration (e.g., Pseudomonas fuscovaginae).
The fungus invades rice through the plant's stomates and wounds and grows intercellularly in the vascular bundles and mesophyll tissues.
The sheath rot fungus survives as a mycelium in infected residue and on seeds.
Management:
Cultural methods:
Removal of infected stubbles after harvest.
optimum plant spacing can reduce the disease.
Application of potash at tillering stage is also recommended.
Control  weeds  and  keep field sanitation.
Preventive method
Bacterization with Pseudomonas fluorescens reduced sheath rot severity by 20-42%, enhanced crop growth, and increased grain yield.
Seed treatment with Pseudomonas fluorescens @ of 10g/kg of seed followed by seedling dip @ of 2.5 kg or products/ha dissolved in 100 litres and dipping for 30 minutes.
Soil application of P.fluorescens @ of 2.5 kg/ha after 30 days of transplanting (This product should be mixed with 50 kg of FYM/Sand and then applied.
Foliar spray at 0.2% concentration Pseudomonas fluorescens   commencing from 45 days after transplanting at 10 days interval for 3 times depending upon the intensity of disease.
Chemical methods:
For control of sheath rot, spray the fungicides at the time of panicle emergence.
Application of a systemic pesticide,Tridemorph (a fungicide) and phosphamidon (an insecticide) in combination protected the plants from sheath rot.
Seed treatment with fungicides such as Mancozeb and Benomyl effectively eliminate seedborne inoculum.
At booting stage, foliar spraying with carbendazim, edifenphos, or mancozeb was found to reduce sheath rot.
Spray Carbendazim 250 g or Chlorothalonil 1 kg/l.
Foliar spraying with Benomyl and copper oxychloride were also found to be effective.

Flase smut:Ustilaginoidea virens
Symptoms:
Individual rice grain transformed into a mass of yellow fruiting bodies.
Growth of velvetty spores that enclose floral parts.
Infected grain has greenish smut balls with a velvetty appearance.
The smut ball appears small at first and grows gradually up to the size of 1 cm.
It is seen in between the hulls and encloses the floral parts.
Only few grains in a panicle are usually infected and the rest are normal.
As the fungi growth intensifies, the smut ball bursts and becomes orange then later yellowish-green or greenish-black in color.
Infection usually occurs during the reproductive and ripening stages, infecting a few grains in the panicle and leaving the rest healthy.
Conditions that favour disease development:
Presence of rain and high humidity.
Presence of soils with high nitrogen content.
Presence of wind for dissemination of the spores from plant to plant.
Presence of overwintering fungus as sclerotia and chlamydospores.
Flowering stage of the rice crop.
Identification of pathogen:
Chlamydospore formed on the spore balls are born laterally on minute sterigmata on radial hyphae, and are spherical to elliptical, warty, olivaceous, 3-5 x 4-6 µm. Younger spores are smaller, paler, and almost smooth.
Some of the green spore balls develop one to four sclerotia in the center. These sclerotia overwinter in the field and produce stalked stromata the following summer or autumn.
In temperate regions, the fungus survives the winter by means of sclerotia as well as chlamydospores.
It is believed that the primary infections are initiated mainly by the ascospores produced from the sclerotia.
Chlamydospores play an important role in secondary infection, which is a major part of the disease cycle.
Management:
Cultural methods:
Among the cultural control, destruction of straw and stubble from infected plants is recommended to reduce the disease.
Use varieties that are found to be resistant or tolerant against the disease in India.
Avoid field activities when the plants are wet.
Early planted crop has less smut balls than the late planted crop.
At the time of harvesting, diseased plants should be removed and destroyed so that sclerotia do not fall in the field.
This will reduce primary inoculum for the next crop.
Field bunds and irrigation channels should be kept clean to eliminate alternate hosts.
Excess application of nitrogenous fertilizer should be avoided.
Regular monitoring of disease incidence during rabi season is very essential.
Proper Destruction of straw and stubble.
Preventive methods
Use of disease-free seeds that are selected from healthy crop.
Seed treatment with carbendazim 2.0g/kg of seeds.
Control insect pests.
Split application of nitrogen is recommended.
Removal and proper disposal of infected plant debris.
Life cycle of Ustilaginoidea virens.
Chemical methods:
Spraying of copper oxychloride at 2.5 g/litre or Propiconazole at 1.0 ml/litre at boot leaf and milky stages will be more useful to prevent the fungal infection.
Seed treatment with carbendazim 2.0g/kg of seeds.
At tillering and preflowering stages, spray Hexaconazole @ 1ml/lit or Chlorothalonil 2g/lit.
In areas where the disease may cause yield loss, applying captan, captafol, fentin hydroxide, and mancozeb can be inhibited conidial germination.
At tillering and preflowering stages, spraying of carbendazim fungicide and copper base fungicide can effectively control the disease.
Symptoms:
Diseased hills are severely stunted with excessive tillering and a very upright growth habit.
Diseased hills has a grassy and rosette appearance.
Leaves short, narrow, and yellowish green with numerous small rusty spots or patches, which form blotches.
Retention of green coloration of the leaves after application of sufficient nitrogenous fertilizers.
Infected plants usually survive until maturity, but produce no paniclesThe symptom develops 10-20 days after infection.
Identification of pathogen:
The virus exists in the vector and in the rice crop. Brown planthopper nymphs and adults transmit it where rice is grown year-round.
RGSV is generally endemic.
The macropterous forms or the long winged adults of the insect are important in spreading the disease than the short winged forms.
They feed on the diseased plant for at least 30 minutes to pick-up the virus.
Higher infection is attained after prolonged inoculation feeding periods of up to 24 hours.
The availability of the vector encourages the damage. Rice grassy stunt virus (RGSV) is a member of the Tenuiviruses.
It has fine filamentous particles, which are 6-8 nm in diameter.
It has a nodal contour length of 950-1,350 nm.
The particles have one capsid protein and the genome is made up of four single-stranded RNA.
Management:
Avoid close planting and provide 30 cm rogue spacing at every 2.5 to 3.0 m to reduce the pest incidence.
There are varieties released by IRRI, which contain genes for BPH resistance, like IR26, IR64, IR36, IR56, and IR72.
Ploughing and harrowing the field to destroy stubbles right after harvest in order to eradicate other hosts.
Apply any one of the following to control vector BPH.

Bacterial Leaf Blight: Xanthomonas phaseoli.
Symptom
The fungus attacks all aerial part parts and at any stage of plant growth.
Symptoms are circular, black, sunken spots with dark center and bright red orange margins on leaves and pods.
In severe infections, the affected parts wither off.
Seedlings get blighted due to infection soon after seed germination.
The pathogen survives on seed and plant debris.
Disease spreads in the field through air-borne conidia.
The disease is more sever in cool and wet seasons.
Management
Use disease free seed.
Destruction of debris and stubbles.
Soak the seeds in 500 ppm Streptocycline solution for 30 min. before sowing followed by two sprays of Streptocycline combined with 3 g of Copper Oxychloride per litre at an interval of 12 days is recommended.

Leaf Crinkle: Leaf Crinkle Virus.
Symptom
The earliest symptoms appear on youngest leaves as chlorosis around some lateral veins and its branches near the margin.
The leaves show curling of margin downwards.
Some of the leaves show twisting.
The veins show reddish brown discolouration on the under surface which also extends to the petiole.
Plants showing symptoms within 5 weeks after sowing invariably remain stunted and majority of  these die due to top necrosis within a week or two.
Plants infected in late stages of growth do not show severe curling and twisting of the leaves but show conspicuous venial chlorosis any where on the leaf lamina.
The disease develops in the fields mainly through seed or rubbing of diseased leaves with the healthy ones.
Management
Growing resistant varieties such as VBN 4, VBN 6 and VBN 7.
Seed treatment with Dimethoate (or) Imidacloprid @ 5 ml /kg.
Installation of yellow sticky traps 12 nos/ha.
Rogue out the infected plants up to 45 days.
Foliar spray of notchi leaf extract 10% at 30 DAS or neem formulation 3 ml/lit.
Spray methyl demeton 25 EC 500 ml/ha or dimethoate 30 EC 500 ml/ha or thiamethoxam 75 WS 1g /3 lit and repeat after 15 days, if necessary.

Late leaf spot: Phaeoisariopsis personatum
Symptom
Infection starts around 55-57 days after sowing in Kharif and 42-46 days after sowing in Rabi.
Black & nearly circular spots appear on the lower surface of the leaflets.
Lesions are rough in appearance. In extreme cases many lesions coalesce resulting in premature senescence and shedding of the leaflets.
Management
Intercropping pearl millet or sorghum with groundnut (1 : 3) is useful in reducing the intensity of late leafspot.
Crop rotation with non-host crops preferably cereals.
Deep burying of crop residues in the soil, removal of volunteer groundnut plants are important measures in reducing the primary source of infection.
Spray Carbendazim 0.1% or Mancozeb 0.2% or Chlorothalonil 0.2%.


Alternaria leaf disease: Alternaria arachidis and A. tenuissima
Symptom
Lesions produced by A. arachidis are brown in colour and irregular in shape surrounded by yellowish halos.
Symptoms produced by A. tenuissima are characterized by blighting of apical portions of leaflets which turn light to dark brown colour.
In the later stages of infection, blighted leaves curl inward and become brittle.
Lesions produced by A. alternata are small, chlorotic, water soaked, that spread over the surface of the leaf.
The lesions become necrotic and brown and are round to irregular in shape.
Veins and veinlets adjacent to the lesions become necrotic. Lesions increase in area and their central portions become pale, rapidly dry out, and disintegrate.
Affected leaves show chlorosis and in severe attacks become prematurely senescent.
Lesions can coalesce, give the leaf a ragged and blighted appearance.
Management
Foliar application of Mancozeb (0.3%) or Copper oxychloride (0.3%) or Carbendazim(0.1%).


Damping off: Pythium aphanidermatum, Pythium debaryanum.
Symptom
Damping off is a serious problem in tobacco nurseries both in heavy clay soils and light sandy soils.
It is caused by several soil inhabiting fungi predominant being Pythium aphanidermatum, pythium debaryanum,Phytophthora sp. and some times Rhizoctonia solani are also involved.
The disease may appear at any stage of the seedlings but maximum damage is observed 5-6 weeks after sowing.
Disease is noticed in two phases, viz.
Pre-emergence damping-off.
Post-emergence damping-off.
Pre-emergence damping-off.
Seedlings are infected which die before emergence from the soil resulting in poor and uneven stand of the seedlings.
Post-emergence damping-off
Post emergence damping- off is the most destructive phase.
The tiny two leaved seedlings may disappear due to wet rotting of stems and the seedlings stand diminishes daily.
Generally damping-off occurs in patches which spread quickly if unchecked.
The older seedlings show shriveling and brown discoloration of the stems near the soils and start rotting under wet soil conditions.
The decayed stems collapse and seedlings topple over leaving parchment like brown crest over the soil.
The wet rotting and sudden collapse of seedlings starts in circular patches and under wet weather conditions may extend over the whole seedbed causing near total loss.
Management
Deep ploughing in summer destroys the fungus.
Preparation of raised seed beds 15 cm high with channels around to provide drainage.
Rabbing the seed bed before sowing with slow burn farm waste materials like paddy husk, tobacco stubbles, waste grass and palmyrah leaves etc.
Use seed rate 3 g/ha only to avoid over crowding of seedlings.
Regulate waterings to avoid excessive dampness on bed surface.
Bordeaux mixture 0.4% @ (40 gm of copper sulphate +40 gm of lime in 10 litres of water) or Copper oxychloride @ 0.2% (20 gm in 10 litres of water) is to be applied with rose can to a bed of 10 sq.m area 2 weeks after sowing.
Two to three spray drenchings of beds with 0.2% Metalaxyl comencing three weeks ofter seed sowing (20 g of Metalaxyl in 10 l of water).
This has to be repeated once in 4 days under normal weather conditions and once in 2 days under wet and cloudy conditions. In case of heavy rain, the application has to be repeated.
Schedule of application
Application of fungicide should be given one week after completion of germination.
Subsequent application, depending upon weather conditions, should be given at 4 days interval if it is bright, sunny and dry, and 2 days when it is cloudy and wet weather.
Application should be repeated after every rain.
Approximately 40 litres of spray fluid for 40 m2 of seedbeds, applied through a rose-can or 20 litres through knapsack sprayer is required for each application.

Brown Spot: Alternaria longipes, Alternaria tenuis, Alternaria alternata
Symptom
Brown spot in contrast to frog-eye spot is not normally observed in the nursery but is very much prevalent in the field.
In India a decade back it was considered to be of minor importance but gradually it is gaining importance specially in tobacco grown in monsoon season.
Initially it appears on lower and older leaves as small brown, circular lesions, which spread, to upper leaves, petioles, stalks and capsules even.
In warm weather (300C) under high humidity, the leaf spots enlarge, 1-3 cm in diameter, centres are necroses and turn brown with characteristic marking giving target board appearance with a definite outline.
In severe infection spots enlarge, coalesce and damage large areas making leaf dark-brown, ragged and worthless.
Management
Removal and destruction of diseased plant debris can check the primary infection promptly.
Continuous growing of tobacco after tobacco must be avoided in the heavily infected fields.
Weekly, spraying of fungicides such as Maneb - 0.2%.
