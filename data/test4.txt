Rhizoctonia seedling blight, sometimes called Rhizoctonia tip blight and stem rot of pea, occurs only occasionally and is generally of minor importance.
The above ground symptom of this disease is the death of the growing tip of very young pea seedlings.
Rhizoctonia attacks up to 0.5 inch (1.3 cm) of the tip of the shoot just as it emerges through the soil and before leaves expand.
Often one or two auxiliary shoots arise from the seed within a few days after the first.
They may also become infected, or they may proceed to produce a normal (but later) plant.
A tan to dark brown stem rot may occur near the ground surface area of pea seedlings.
